Regardless of where you stand on the 'hamburger menu' style of navigation, its ubiquitous presence on the vast majority of websites makes implementing one a seemingly inevitable task for front end engineers these days. Putting aside our love/hate for the 'burger', let's look at how we can implement one with accessibility front and centre.

Building out the core functionality is mostly trivial - navigation items are hidden off-screen, often using the `translate()` CSS function, then revealed on the click of a button (that just happens to look like a hamburger üçîüòã). What we're interested in here is achieving this seemingly simple functionality in an accessible manner. In doing so we'll be ensuring that:

- Tab focus isn't 'lost' on elements that are visually hidden
- Tab focus is locked to the nav items when navigation is visible
- Screen readers are presented with the correct HTML elements
- ARIA attributes are employed only where necessary

### Standard implementation

Let‚Äôs start by looking at a stock standard implementation of a hamburger menu and examine where we can improve upon it.

> Although this tutorial uses React as the working example, the principles covered here apply to any framework, including good old plain JavaScript
