Source code for a previous version of my personal website, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`.

## Tech

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped using `create-next-app` with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- CSS-in-JS is a combination of [Rebass](https://github.com/rebassjs/rebass) and [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)
- Articles written in MDX are loaded via [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
- Syntax highlighting is handled by [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) with [Dmitri Voronianski's](https://github.com/voronianski) Oceanic Next theme
- Scroll-based animations made easy thanks to the [react-intersection-observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer) package
- Staggered content fade-in with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
